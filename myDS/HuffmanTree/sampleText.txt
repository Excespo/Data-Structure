One of the simplest and effective methods of designing IIR digital filters with prescribed
magnitude response specifications is the bilinear transformation method.
Instead of designing the digital filter directly, the method maps the digital filter into
an equivalent analog filter, which can be designed by one of the well-developed analog
filter design methods, such as Butterworth, Chebyshev, or elliptic filter designs. The
designed analog filter is then mapped back into the desired digital filter. The procedure
is illustrated in Fig. 11.1.1.
